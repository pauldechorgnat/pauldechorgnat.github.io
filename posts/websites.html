        <h1>Websites</h1><p>I have created several websites over the years. Most of them are not very good but they exist. I have used Heroku for most of them. So here they are ! (I'll try to find the time to link the source codes too)</p><h2>Blindfold Chess</h2><p>This website was created for me to learn how to play chess with a blindfold. I never really used it but I am quite pleased with how it turned out. We find all the exercises that are generally offered to learn blindfolded chess. I hope it will be used here by someone: <a href="https://blind-fold-chess.herokuapp.com/">BlindFoldChess</a>.</p><h2>CodeName</h2><p><em>CodeName</em> is another board game that I used to play with friends. During lockdown, I had the idea of creating my own online multiplayer version of the game. It was also an interesting way to learn about web sockets. It is available <a href="https://codename-paul.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p><h2>When I Dream</h2><p><em>When I Dream</em> is a board game that I used to play with friends where people must make a player guess cards based on one word clues. I tried to create a website to emulate the game and replace the cars and hourglass. It is also my first experience with the creation of a website with NodeJS. It is available <a href="https://whenidream.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p><h2>Wine App</h2><p>Some context: my parents are huge wine lovers. For Christmas 2018, I created a set of cards for my mother so that she could learn about wines, grape types, ... At the same time I was going through the amazing <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Mega Flask tutorial</a>. So I tried to make my own website using Flask because a website is easier to carry than a set of cards. This gave <a href="https://desolate-brushlands-35398.herokuapp.com/">this Wine App website</a>. It is utterly broken but I'll try to fix it some times soon.</p>
