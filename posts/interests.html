        <h1>Main interests</h1><h2>Mathematics</h2><p>My current focus is mainly on Graph Theory and Bayesian Statistics.</p><h3>Graph Theory</h3><p>I am currently studying Marc Barthélemy's book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-94106-2"><em>Spatial Networks</em></a>. Spatial 
Networks are Graphs for which points are located into an Euclidean Space. Distance between nodes can be computed in two ways (in a straight line or by hopping from node to node).</p><p>I am also trying to create a <a href="https://pypi.org/pypi/spatial-networks">Python library</a> to deal with these spatial networks.The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/pauldechorgnat/spatial-networks">here</a>.</p><h3>Bayesian Statistics</h3><p>Per my training, I am mostly familiar with frequentist statistics (at least somewhat familiar). But after hearing so much good about Bayesian Statistics, Bayesian models, simulations, (...) I've decided to take a look a it. I am reading <a href="https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/">Bayes Rules Book</a>. I am also converting R examples from this book to <a href="">Python code</a>.</p><p><div class="img-container"><img alt="Example of a Spatial Graph" src="/images/demo_random_graph.png" /></div></p><h2>Chess</h2><p>I have been very interested in chess for some years. Currently trying to play a bit less to let place to other interests. Currently 2000 elo on Lichess in every category but I haven't played on Lichess for months. Oscillating between 1650 and 1800 on chess.com.</p><p>I play mainly:</p><ul>
<li>The Scott</li>
<li>The Advanced French</li>
<li>The Sicilian (Dragon)</li>
</ul><h2>History</h2><p>I have always been a fan of history (and even wanted to be an historian when younger). I do not have any particular tropism towards any period. I listen to a lot of conference by french historians (Johann Chapoutot, Christian Ingrao, Nicolas Patin, Michel Pastoureau, ...) and other institutions (Collège de France, École des Chartes, ...) and recently discovered a wonderful set of podcasts: <a href="https://passionmedievistes.fr/">Passion Médiéviste</a> (I am currently making my way through Middle Age episodes).</p><h2>Politics, Anthropology, Sociology</h2><p>This is one of my main interest: trying to understand how our societies work, alone or together in order to understand political levers (means of action). It links a bit the other interests: Mathematics for measuring or simulating effects, Anthropology and History to understand how things were to become the way they are today, Sociology to get the base concepts for simulation, Politics for action possibility. In that way, I find Emmanuel's Todd work very interesting, mixing all of this together to get something that, at least, seems very accurate.</p>
