                My name is Paul Déchorgnat. I am a 28 years old French Engineer trained at École Centrale Paris (currently CentraleSupélec). I have worked for <a href="https://datascientest.com/">DataScientest.com</a> for 4 years as a Data Scientist/Data Engineer. I have a degree in Applied Mathematics and a specialization in Data Science. I am not the biggest fan of Machine Learning but I really enjoy what can be done with data. I especially enjoy working with graphs which are, for me, ones of the most elegant objects in mathematics.

                        Euclidean Space. Distance between nodes can be computed in two ways (in a straight line or by hopping from node to node).
                        <br> I am also trying to create a <a href="https://pypi.org/pypi/spatial-networks">Python library</a> to deal with these spatial networks.The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/pauldechorgnat/spatial-networks">here</a>.

                        to take a look a it. I am reading <a href="https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/">Bayes Rules Book</a>. I am also converting R examples from this book to <a href="">Python code</a>.

                I have been very interested in chess for some years. Currently trying to play a bit less to let place to other interests. Currently 2000 elo on Lichess in every category but I haven't played on Lichess for months. Oscillating between 1650 and 1800 on
                chess.com.
                <br> Playing mainly:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Scott</li>
                    <li>The Advanced French</li>
                    <li>The Sicilian (dragon)</li>
                </ul>
                I'll try to learn more openings in the future.

                History
            </div>
            <div class="menu-text">
                I have always been a fan of history (and even wanted to be an historian when younger). I do not have any particular tropism towards any period. I listen to a lot of conference by french historians (Johann Chapoutot, Christian Ingrao, Nicolas Patin, Michel
                Pastoureau, ...) and other institutions (Collège de France, École des Chartes, ...) and recently discovered a wonderful set of podcasts: <a href="https://passionmedievistes.fr/">Passion Médiéviste</a> (I am currently making
                my way through Middle Age episodes).

            <div class="menu-subtitle">
                Politics, Anthropology, Sociology
            </div>
            <div class="menu-text">
                This is one of my main interest: trying to understand how our societies work, alone or together in order to understand political levers (means of action). It links a bit the other interests: Mathematics for measuring or simulating effects, Anthropology
                and History to understand how things were to become the way they are today, Sociology to get the base concepts for simulation, Politics for action possibility. In that way, I find Emmanuel's Todd work very interesting, mixing all of this
                together to get something that, at least, seems very accurate.

                This website was created for me to learn how to play chess with a blindfold. I never really used it but I am quite pleased with how it turned out.

                <i>CodeName</i> is another board game that I used to play with friends. During lockdown, I had the idea of creating my own online multiplayer version of the game.

                <i>When I Dream</i> is a board game that I used to play with friends where people must make a player guess cards based on one word clues. I tried to create a website to emulate the game and replace the cars and hourglass. It is also my first experience with the creation of a website with NodeJS. It is available <a href="https://whenidream.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.

            <div class="menu-text">
                Some context: my parents are huge wine lovers. For Christmas 2018, I created a set of cards for my mother so that she could learn about wines, grape types, ... At the same time I was going through the amazing <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Mega Flask tutorial</a>. So I tried to make my own website using Flask because a website is easier to carry than a set of cards. This gave <a href="https://desolate-brushlands-35398.herokuapp.com/">this Wine App website</a>. It is utterly broken but I'll try to fix it some times soon.
