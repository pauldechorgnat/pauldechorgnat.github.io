# Hello World

> Hi there ! This is my personal website where I talk about some interests of mine. I do not know exactly where this is going but I'll try to update it frequently. Oh and it's ugly on purpose :)


## Who am I ?

My name is Paul Déchorgnat. I am a 28 years old French Engineer trained at École Centrale Paris (currently CentraleSupélec). I have worked for <a href="https://datascientest.com/">DataScientest.com</a> for 4 years as a Data Scientist/Data Engineer. I have a degree in Applied Mathematics and a specialization in Data Science. I am not the biggest fan of Machine Learning but I really enjoy what can be done with data. I especially enjoy working with graphs which are, for me, ones of the most elegant objects in mathematics.
