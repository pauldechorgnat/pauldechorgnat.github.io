# Hello World

> Hi there ! This is my personal website where I talk about some interests of mine. I do not know exactly where this is going but I'll try to update it frequently. Oh and it's ugly on purpose :)

## Who am I ?

My name is Paul Déchorgnat. I am a 28 years old French Engineer trained at École Centrale Paris (currently CentraleSupélec). I have worked for <a href="https://datascientest.com/">DataScientest.com</a> for 4 years as a Data Scientist/Data Engineer. I have a degree in Applied Mathematics and a specialization in Data Science. I am not the biggest fan of Machine Learning but I really enjoy what can be done with data. I especially enjoy working with graphs which are, for me, ones of the most elegant objects in mathematics.

## Interests

My main current interests are:

- Mathematics
- Chess
- History
- Politics, Sociology, Anthropology

I've added details [here](posts/interests.md)

## Reading

I am currently reading multiple books and I take notes on these books. I might publish some notes on the book. You can find the list of books I read this year [here](posts/readings.md).

## Repositories and websites

I have created multiple websites that are described [here](posts/websites.md). I also have nearly 50 repositories on [Github](https://github.com/pauldechorgnat). I have described some of the interesting ones [here](posts/repos.md).

## Tools

[Here](posts/tools.md), I describe the different tools that I use.
