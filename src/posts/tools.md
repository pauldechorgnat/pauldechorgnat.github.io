# Tools, Languages and other

Given my work as an instructor, I have learnt to use a lot of different tools.

## Programming Languages

Python (main language), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, R

Python libraries in particular: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `keras`, `networkx`, `shapely`, `geopandas`, `fastapi`, `flask`, `boto3`, `airflow`, `dash`, ...

## Dev tools

Developing: Git, Github (including Github Actions), VSCode, Jupyter Lab, ...

Managing: Docker, Kubernetes, Airflow, Serverless

Monitoring: Datadog, Sentry

## Cloud

Azure: I am a certified Data Engineer for Azure (DP203)

AWS: AWS has been an everyday tool for me for 4 years (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, IAM, ...)

## Other

Obsidian (note taking): I am trying to apply [this book](https://www.amazon.fr/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/1542866502) techniques. I am currently building a knowledge graph of notes about all my interests. I might publish some part of it in the future.
