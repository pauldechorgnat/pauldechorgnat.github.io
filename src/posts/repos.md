# Repositories

I have a lot of repositories on my Github account. Here I'll try to explain some of them.

## <a href="https://github.com/pauldechorgnat/spatial-networks">Spatial Networks</a>

This repository contains my work on the library Spatial Networks. This library is used to manipulate Graph that are located in space. It is both an occasion to play with spatial graphs but also an opportunity to learn how to develop a Python library. You can see how this library works by going to <a href="https://github.com/pauldechorgnat/spatial-networks/blob/master/notebooks/02_basic_graphs.ipynb">this notebook</a>.

## <a href="https://github.com/pauldechorgnat/mortality">Mortality</a>

A quick repo to build GIFs based on mortality rates in France.

## <a href="https://github.com/pauldechorgnat/datatelier-twitter">Datatelier Twitter</a>


This repository is a repository that I used for support for a workshop I made on using Twitter data. (The name comes from the contraction of Data and Atelier (Workshop in French)). A Youtube recording of the workshop (in French) is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qoDhxDN3ls">here</a>.

## <a href="https://github.com/pauldechorgnat/data-chomage">Data Chomage</a>

A simple cleaning of data relative to the unemployment rate in France at a low granularity.

## <a href="https://github.com/pauldechorgnat/allocations">Allocations</a>

A simple cleaning of data relative to different allowances in France. There is still a lot to do on this data.

## <a href="https://github.com/pauldechorgnat/ising-model">Ising Model</a>

A small study on the Ising Model (a Statistical Physics model) that can be applied to socio-economic problems too. Still a Work In Progress though.

## <a href="https://github.com/pauldechorgnat/projet-datascience">Projet Data Science</a>

A small repository dedicated to the study of a e-commerce website data. This repo was used for educational purposes but might be a bit outdated.
